# Google Ad Conversions Plugin (with Zapier)

Sends Google Ads conversion events to a Zapier webhook.

Given a set of conversion definitions, call a Zapier webhook with all events that match conversions. In production, this webhook is configured to add a row to a Google Sheet which is then ingested by Google Ads.

This plugin is still in active development within PostHog and should not be considered a stable release.

## Configuration

See [plugin.json](/plugin.json) and [conversion_definitions.example.json](/conversion_definitions.example.json).
